# components

In Next.js, components are object that you can place into html the same way you would put in a regular html tag. You define them as a JavaScript function that returns and html object, like how the pages work.

This is useful for creating cleaner, more readable code that you can also test and finalize independantly of the rest of your project. Additionally, components don't have to be restricted to a single project, and you can easily copy them and put them into your own website if you wanted! Reusable code is the secret to how people build websites faster over the years, after all.

You can reference the Next.js docs about components [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components).
