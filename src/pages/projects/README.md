# pages\projects

This folder contains the template used for the individual project posts that are dynamically generated from markdown files.

The actual project markdown files are inside ```/posts``` in the root directory of the site. 

This is based on the ```gray-matter``` library, which you need to install with:
```npm install gray-matter```

The documantation can be found here: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter]
