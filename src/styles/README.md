# styles

Styles work the same way here in Next.js as they do in any other web project. These are all just files that you can import into a page (or an individual component!) to stylize the plain html.

The general convention is to title the page as ```'Page/Component Name'.module.css```.

W3 Schools has a pretty good reference for CSS: [https://www.w3schools.com/css/].
