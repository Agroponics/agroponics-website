# agroponics-website

Welcome to the behind-the-scenes of our design team's website! Whether you're an Agroponics member who wants to work on the website, or just curious and browsing around, these ```README``` files will give you a brief explanation of what's going on in the code and how you can get started on writing your own code or making your own project post for the site!


## File Organization

```\.github```: This folder is for GitHub pages to figure out how to build and deploy the page. ```.\github\workflows\nextjs.yml``` is where the GitHub Action is specifically defined. Since it's been done before, we won't need to do it again, but you can reference [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-next-js-app-to-github-pages/) tutorial to learn how to do it yourself for your own website!

```\.next```, ```\.out```: These folders are generated by the compiler and define how the site is built. You'll never need to touch these, so don't worry about it!

```\.node_modules``` is also machine generated, and lists each of the installed packages and libraries we use. These were installed by typing ```npm install 'package-name'```. Since they've been installed once, we don't need to install them again, but keep that in mind for your own personal projects!

```\posts```: This folder contains the markdown files that are dynamically converted into HTML objects to create our Project Posts on the website. There's more details further down in *this* file under the *Writing Posts* section.

```\public```: The public folder of any Next.js project is for files that, surprise surprise, anyone can fetch through a regular HTML GET request. Try it right now, visit [https://ubcagroponics.com/dog.jpg], and you'll see that you can access the file for yourself! We use this for our ```favicon.ico``` (the little photo that pops up when you look at the tab the website is open in), and the images for the projects (they need to be public for the dynamic content generation to access them).

```\src```: This folder is where the bulk of the user-written code is. There's a whole other README file in it to explain the folders in more detail, but essentially that's where the developers write their code and define, pages, styles, and components, as well as store images that aren't fetchable through HTML requests.

```jsconfig.json```, ```next.config.mjs```, ```package-lock.json```, and ```package.json``` all contain configurations for the compiler to figure out how to build the project properly. You'll *rarely* need to go through them, only when you add some really funky custom features or need to configure packages, so don't worry about it. 


## Writing Posts

The projects page of this site contains links to project articles that are dynamically generated from Markdown files. They are all stored in ```/posts``` in the route directory of this repository. Their respective images for the projects are stored under ```public/projectIMGS```. The Markdown files follow the following format

```
---
title: "Post Title" 
date: "xx-xxxx" *//format is month-year*
id: "lowercase_id" *//name of file stored in ```public/projectIMGs```* 
cover_image: "filename.jpg" *//name of file stored in ```public/projectIMGs```*
subteam: 'subteam' *//must be either ```automation```, ```structure```, or ```plants```*
header: "Header Of Article"   *//more detailed than title*
---
The bodytext goes here
```

If you've never written Markdown before, here's a good guide on the syntax:

## Getting Started With Development 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To get testing, first initiate the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the live code being compiled from your computer. Any changes you make to the code will happen live, but they won't appear on the actual website until you push your changes to GitHub.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

We've already done this once and so should never need to do it again (hopefully). In case this repository magically explodes or something, this is a tutorial on how we did it: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-next-js-app-to-github-pages/
