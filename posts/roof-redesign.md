At Agroponics UBC, we’re not just growing plants; we’re cultivating innovative solutions. As part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the trailer housing our hydroponic systems, we’ve undertaken a critical project: redesigning the trailer’s roof, which as of now is rusting and has begun to leak. 

This isn’t just about keeping the rain out—it’s about ensuring long-term durability, safety, and future-proofing our setup for new technologies. In our redesign, we carefully considered various factors. 

First, waterproofing was a top priority, ensuring that our systems remain protected from the elements. To prevent rust and extend the life, we’re exploring the use of corrosion-resistant materials and protective coatings. Additionally, we’ve kept future upgrades in mind, ensuring that the new roof can support the installation of solar panels, enabling us to harness renewable energy down the line. 

Safety is always at the forefront of our projects, so we’re taking extra precautions during construction to protect our team members. We’ve meticulously planned the roof’s dimensions and structural integrity to ensure it can withstand various loads and environmental conditions, all while providing a stable platform for ongoing and future innovations. 

Our design is shown in the image above. 

This redesign is more than just a technical upgrade—it’s a step toward a more sustainable, resilient future for our hydroponic systems and our mission to advance sustainable agriculture. Stay tuned as we continue to build and renovate the trailer!
