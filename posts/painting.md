# Giving Our Trailer a Fresh New Look

![Painting](../images/projectIMGs/painting.jpg "Paint")

We recently gave our trailer a much-needed makeover! After noticing that it was starting to rust and the paint was chipping away, we decided it was time for a change. But this wasn’t just about protection—it was also a celebration. 

We had just secured the trailer, and what better way to mark the occasion than by giving it a fresh coat of paint? The new paint job not only shields the trailer from further deterioration but also reflects our excitement and pride in this key part of our project. And this is just the beginning! 

We’re already planning to add some creative murals to the trailer in the near future, turning it into a vibrant representation of the Agroponics UBC spirit. Stay tuned to see how we’ll transform this trailer into something truly special!
