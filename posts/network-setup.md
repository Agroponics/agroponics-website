We are excited to announce the successful setup of our Raspberry Pi, now connected to the UBC secure network and our home assistant domain. This configuration is a cornerstone of the Agroponics UBC project, playing a pivotal role in ensuring seamless communication and control across our hydroponic systems.

The Raspberry Pi serves as the central hub for our smart hydroponic setup, acting as the broker for the MQTT system. This setup allows us to efficiently manage data from various sensors, enabling real-time monitoring and automation through the Home Assistant platform. The ability to connect the Raspberry Pi to both the UBC network and our custom domain significantly enhances our capacity to manage the system remotely, offering a robust solution for continuous, unattended operation.

Moreover, this network configuration is critical for scalability. As we expand our hydroponic systems and integrate more sensors, the need for a reliable and secure communication backbone becomes even more important. The successful network setup ensures that we can scale our operations while maintaining control and oversight, ultimately supporting the project’s long-term goals of creating a sustainable, high-yield hydroponic farming system.

This milestone is a testament to the hard work and expertise of our team. Their efforts have laid a solid foundation for the continued success and expansion of the Agroponics UBC project.
