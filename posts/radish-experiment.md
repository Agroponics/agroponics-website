The Plants team at Agroponics UBC is diving deeper into the science of hydroponics with an exciting experiment on tuber growth. Recently, we successfully grew radishes using a deep water culture hydroponic system, aiming to understand how these root vegetables thrive in a soilless environment. After harvesting, we froze the radishes to preserve their nutritional integrity for further analysis.

Next, our team will utilize advanced lab equipment, including UV-Vis spectrophotometry and HPLC, to assess the nutritional content of the radishes. This analysis will help us determine how different growing conditions impact the nutrient profile of tuber plants in hydroponic systems. The results of this study will not only enhance our understanding of hydroponic farming but also guide future experiments to optimize the growth and nutritional value of crops.

This experiment marks an important step in our mission to develop sustainable, efficient, and nutritionally rich farming practices through hydroponics. Stay tuned for more updates as we delve into the data and share our findings!
