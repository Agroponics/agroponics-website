# Exploring Tuber Growth in Hydroponics – Radish Study Underway

![Radishes](../images/projectIMGs/radishes.jpg "The Radishes")

We’ve made significant strides in the Agroponics UBC project with the successful integration of multiple sensors using the ESP32 microcontroller. This achievement is not just a technical milestone—it’s a crucial component of our overall goal to develop a fully automated, smart hydroponic system. 

The integration of sensors, including the pH, temperature, and flow rate sensors, is foundational for real-time monitoring and control of the hydroponic environment. Accurate sensor data is essential for maintaining optimal growing conditions, such as pH levels and water temperature, which directly impact plant health and yield. 

By transmitting this data via MQTT to our Home Assistant platform, we can automate responses to environmental changes, ensuring that the system operates efficiently and sustainably without constant manual intervention. This development brings us closer to realizing a truly intelligent hydroponic system, capable of adjusting to environmental variables in real-time. 

The success of this integration underlines the importance of precise data collection and management in modern agriculture, helping us create a more sustainable and resource-efficient farming model. 

Kudos to the team for their dedication and technical expertise in achieving this critical milestone!
